# Call-manager
Part1:
Given a database of contacts (with their info's) but we're only working with the phone numbers.
The program will:
- Check for duplicates in phone numbers, when found: display the phone number and the location of the duplicates(their usernames which is in the database)
- if the phone number is a duplicate but with different info for the contact mark it as well/ display it with the different information
- if the same location name has many phone numbers add it as second/3rd.. phone number
- Delete the duplicates after the steps above are done to ensure that no valuable information is lost
- Update the Contact database


Part2:

- Create a repository for phone numbers we're calling
- Enter the phone number we're calling/going to call
- Add it to the repository
- Display that it has been added as a newly called phone number
- take notes for current call

From there on, when a phone number is entered for calling the program will:
- Check if it's already in the list or not
If it is already in the list, then display that it's already been called so that we can move onto the next one
